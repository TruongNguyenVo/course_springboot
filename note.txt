Rules to create query methods
1. The name of our query method must start with one of the following prefixes: find...By,
read...By, query...By, count...By, and get...By.
Examples: findByName, readByName, queryByName, getByName

2. If we want to limit the number of returned query results, we can add the First or the Top
keyword before the first By word.
Examples: findFirstByName, readFirst2ByName, findTop10ByName

3. If we want to select unique results, we have to add the Distinct keyword before the first
By word.
Examples: findDistinctByName or findNameDistinctBy

4. Combine property expression with AND and OR.
Examples: findByNameOrDescription, findByNameAndDescription

Steps to create and use Spring Data JPA Repository
1. Create a repository interface and extend to JpaRepository interface
2. Add custom query methods to the created repository interface (if we need them)
3. Inject the repository interface to another component and use the implementation that is provided automatically by Spring Data Jpa.
